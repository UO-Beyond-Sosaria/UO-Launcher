# UO Beyond Sosaria – Launcher

Welcome to **UO Beyond Sosaria**!
Our shard is heavily modified to bring you features you won’t find anywhere else. The **custom game launcher** ensures your files are always up-to-date — no patching, no headaches.

## Launcher Options

The launcher includes three assistant choices:

* **Razor Enhanced**
* **ClassicAssist**
* **Razor CE**

Pick your favorite and jump right into Sosaria.

## 📥 Installation

3. Run `UltimaEclipse.exe` as **Administrator**

### Option 2 – Git Clone

##  Importing Assistant Profiles

Keep your existing macros & settings by copying them into the new directories:

* **Razor Enhanced** →
  `data/client/Data/Plugins/RazorEnhanced/Profiles`

* **ClassicAssist** →
  `data/client/Data/Plugins/ClassicAssist/Profiles`

* **Razor CE** →
  `data/client/Data/Plugins/RazorCE/Profiles`

> ⚠ If the folder doesn’t exist yet, run the game once with your chosen assistant (or create the `Profiles` folder manually).

✨ That’s it! Download, install, and begin your adventure in **UO Beyond Sosaria**.

Would you like me to **add styled badges/buttons** (like “Join Discord”, “Download Launcher”, etc.) so the top of the README looks really sharp, like a landing page?
